<p>“Fuck! Go outside, quickly!” you hiss as we both run out to the 陽台 and close the door.<br>
<br>
Through a crack in the window, you see your aunt looking around, but she seems to give up and<br>
leave some food on the chair next to your front door.<br>
<br>
“We did it babe! That was close,” you sigh, relieved. But then you see my face… 😳<br>
<br>
“Babe, look outside…”<br>
<br>
You notice ALL the neighbors looking at us from their own 陽台, and you know that we will end<br>
up on the news tomorrow. 🫣😓</p>
