<p>“Amazing honey! I’m so glad you’re willing to expand your comfort zone with me today. 🥺 I’ll<br>
come pick you up, and then we can go on our surprise date!”<br>
<br>
I take you to the curb, where we wait for an uber I reserved. The uber arrives, and we get in. But<br>
this is not an ordinary uber! It’s even better than a Tesla! It is actually a new service, UberRocket<br>
©, which is flying all the way to my house in Minnesota!<br>
<br>
“Babe, WTF?!” you yell at me.<br>
<br>
“Surprise cutie! We’re gonna go bake desserts at my house! What a fun date!” XD<br>
<br>
The uber car somehow flies into the air, and before you know it, we arrive at my house in<br>
Minnesota.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry babe, I already scheduled the return trip, so you’ll still be home in time for bed” 😘<br>
<br>
We walk into my kitchen, and I ask you: “what do you want to make? Christmas candies, or<br>
bread?”</p>
