<p>We decide to go in through the front entrance, and just as we open the door---your aunt comes<br>
out and sees us holding hands!! 🫣<br>
<br>
It is really embarrassing, but also kinda cute. I feel like she is judging me, but also she seems<br>
like a really nice person. You tell her that I was just dropping you off, and you tell me to go home<br>
while you keep talking to her.<br>
<br>
We go home without making out 😭</p>
