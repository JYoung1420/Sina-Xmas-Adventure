<p>We go back to your apartment, sitting next to each other while you touch me. XD<br>
<br>
We start a Spotify jam and listen to our playlist.<br>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0d6hSFOhCkCebLQiElWRyV?si=a2de1ae91c354bd5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0d6hSFOhCkCebLQiElWRyV?si=a2de1ae91c354bd5</a><br>
<br>
Once we get home, we sneak in through the back entrance to your apartment, and take the<br>
elevator up to 8樓 of the staircase.<br>
<br>
When we get out, no words are necessary. The look in our eyes says more than enough. I push<br>
you up against the wall––my lips race towards yours, and we become one. I breathe you in<br>
between kisses, and whisper sweet nothings in your ear.<br>
<br>
My hands run up and down your body, feeling your heartbeat, your hesitation, and your love. My<br>
leg goes between yours, and you gasp, then lean into it more. We are no longer in the staircase<br>
of your apartment––we are in heaven, just the two of us. Your hair is messy now, but you don’t<br>
care. You are beautiful, and when I am holding you, you feel like it.<br>
<br>
We make out until our lips can’t take it, and even then we keep going anyway. We embrace, and<br>
I hold you. You are my 安安, and I am yours. With one final kiss on your cheek, I let go of your<br>
hand and head home.<br>
<br>
Until next time 😘</p>
