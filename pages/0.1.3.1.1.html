<p>We go to 大安森林公園 with your mom, and we walk around and enjoy the beautiful weather!  I<br>
even hold your hand while we are walking 🫣<br>
<br>
We later go to 永康街, and get 蔥抓餅. Your mom eventually leaves first, and we spend a<br>
moment at 永康公園， the same place where he had our first date.<br>
<br>
“Thanks for a great time babe, and thanks for letting us go with your mom! I appreciate it, and I<br>
appreciate you” 🥹<br>
<br>
We hug, and then we both go home.</p>
