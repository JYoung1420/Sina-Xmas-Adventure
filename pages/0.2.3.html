<p>“Yay!” I text excitedly as I rush over to your house. I get there, open the door, and step inside.<br>
<br>
“Hi hot stuff…,” I say while looking at you with a confident smirk. 😏 I take my outside clothes<br>
off, and I catch you watching me, unable to look away. 🫣<br>
<br>
“Well don’t just look…come join me!” I say.<br>
<br>
As you come to join me, your phone rings…what do you do?</p>
