<p>“Oh wow babe!” I say between kisses from you. “I guess that means ‘yes’?” XDD<br>
<br>
We don’t even wait for the bus. We get an uber and get back to your building ASAP--you can’t<br>
keep your hands off me.<br>
<br>
We walk back to the apartment holding hands, and the look in your eyes almost makes me melt.<br>
🫠 She is SO hot, I think to myself as I look at you, and your eyes say the same thing. We<br>
sneak in through the back entrance of your apartment, and take the elevator up to a quiet part of<br>
the staircase.<br>
<br>
Your hands are reaching places where they shouldn’t––but I don’t care. I lean into it as you feel<br>
me, and I run my hands up and down your body in response. I feel the warmth of your chest as I<br>
sensually drag my hand up your shirt, and you shudder in response.<br>
<br>
You grind on my leg with reckless abandon, your quiet moans filling the staircase. We need to<br>
be quiet, but you can’t help it. A door slams, and we stop. Silence hangs in the air between<br>
us––a shared moment of lust mixed with fear of being discovered. But that’s just what makes it<br>
fun. After a moment, we keep going, until we are sweaty and exhausted, your limbs entangled<br>
with mine as we stand on the landing of the staircase.<br>
<br>
“Better than last time?” I ask. 😉<br>
<br>
You give me one final, long kiss in response, and I hug you close, before heading out into the<br>
night.</p>
